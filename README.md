# TP NGS Elimination
### *Quentin's work (Cenorhabditis)*


### **This project is organised in 3 sections:**

> - **data**
>
> This section contain raw data and is not linked to git.

> - **results**
>
> This section contain the results and is not linked to git.

> - **intermediary_results**
>
> This section contain the intermediary results and is not linked to git.

> - **scripts**
>
> This section contain the different scripts used to transformed the raw data into results. Ths section is saved on git.


### **The project**

This project was initiated by the Dellatre lab. 
This project aim to identify genes that are deferentially expressed at different stages of genome elimination of *Mesorhabditis belari*. 
To do so, genome extraction were preceded at 6 time points of the *M.belari* development, 2 before genome elimination, 2 during genome elimination and 2 after genome elimination. Sample extraction were made in duplicate, thus 12 samples were obtained.
Identification of the transcripts of the differents samples was assessed thanks to Illumina sequencing.

This bioinformatic analysis is then dedicated to the obtained Illumina reads analysis.
